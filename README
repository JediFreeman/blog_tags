Blogtags
==========

Blogtags is a plugin for the [Radiant CMS][1] that provides some useful blogging tags. OK, for now there are just two tags. But they're really useful. Honest!

`previous` and `next`
=====================
The `previous` and `next` tags get the previous and next siblings of the current page. You can specify which attribute to use for comparison in the `by` attribute. For example,

	<r:previous by="published_at"><r:link/></r:previous>
	
Will get the previous page according to the `published_at` date and output a link to it. 

Inside the `next` and `previous` tags you can use whatever page tags you like and they'll refer to the next or previous page. If your pages have a `summary` part, you could output the summary for the next page like this:

	<r:next by="published_at"><r:content part="summary"/></r:next>
	
Of course I have no idea _why_ you'd want to do that, but you could.

Since this is the Blogtags plugin, the `previous` and `next` tags are designed to be used in a blog. Here's how I use the `previous` and `next` tags on [my site][2] to provide links to the previous and next blog entries:

	<div class="article-nav">
		<p><r:previous by="published_at"><r:link>&laquo;&nbsp;<r:title/></r:link>&nbsp;&nbsp;</r:previous><r:next
			by="published_at"><r:link><r:title/>&nbsp;&raquo;</r:link></r:next></p>
	</div>
	
This produces HTML like

	<div class="article-nav">
		<p><a href="/articles/2006/06/06/jimmy-and-ginas-wedding/">&laquo;&nbsp;Jimmy and Gina's Wedding</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a 	
		    href="/articles/2006/06/22/railsconf-2006/">RailsConf 2006&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>
	</div>

When you're viewing the first page in a sequence, the `previous` tag outputs nothing. The `next` tag outputs nothing if you're at the last page in a sequence. Also, virtual pages (like "Archive Day Index" or "Page Not Found") are excluded from the page sequence, since you probably don't want to link to them this way.


`time_ago_in_words`
===================
The `time_ago_in_words` tag outputs the `published_at` date of the page in natural language. For example, if it's 4:00pm and the page was published at 1:00pm the tag

	<r:time_ago_in_words/>
	
would output `about 3 hours`. I use it like this in my blog:

	<p class="article-author">Posted by <r:author /> <r:time_ago_in_words /> ago</p>
	
which outputs something like:

	<p class="article-author">Posted by Sean about 3 hours ago</p>
